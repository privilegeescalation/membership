# Membership Proposal - Rin Oliver

## Intro

As a member of The Privilege Escalation Foundation I will be able to further leverage the skills I have gained as a peer mentor for large events such as KubeCon to mentor others.
This includes helping to onboard them through the membership process, and empowering and encouraging them to reach their own goals.
I have a background in LGBTQ+ youth advocacy, as well as non-profit Board Membership. 
I currently am on the Board of the Diana Initiative for fiscal year 2021, and feel this experience also has provided me with skills I can use to better progress the Foundation and its efforts.
I also have experience in grant writing for non-profits which may be helpful here. 

I expect to be able to contribute around 4-6 hours of my time a week on average. I can, if there is an event or large sponsorship/fundraising undertaking occuring, ramp this time up on weekends.

## Goals

* Sponsor 1 Candidate per quarter
* Reach out to 2-3 grantmakers per funding calendar/period regarding grants/awards the foundation could use to further its goals
* Reach out to 4-6 key decisionmakers regarding sponsorship/charitable donations to the foundation per quarter
* Reach out to 1-2 events per quarter regarding offering the option to donate to the foundation in lieu of swag per quarter
* Begin drafting a list of media outlets to pitch interviews to
* Begin researching ways to automate the many processes involved in running a non-profit foundation

I also am committted to scoping, re-defining, walking back, or tabling goals as necessary to focus on more achievable targets. 

## Closing

Thank you for your time and consideration! :) I look forward to hearing from you.
