# Membership Proposal - Pedro Medeiros

## Intro

As a member of The Privilege Escalation Foundation, I will help people before, during, and after the sponsorship process. I will not just focus on gender confirming healthcare but the person and being there for them. Since I am cisgender there will be topics I am not qualified to help, in this scenario I will seek education and assistance from other members. I will do what I can to be a positive influence on people's lives.

My time available for the foundation fluctuates I expect to have between 2 and 10 hours a week. This time can be directed at internal support work, asynchronous communication, and audio or video calls when a more personal approach is preferred.

## Goals

- Sponsor at least four candidates per quarter, granted there is enough demand.
- Attend all meetings/votes, with exceptions for planned PTO or emergencies.
- Being active on Discord, with at least a message per week.
- Research and formulate a plan to raise funds for non-profits.
- Review and adjust goals every quarter, increase donations based on failure.
