# Membership Proposal - Selene Xenia

## Intro

As a member of The Privilege Escalation Foundation I can put formally into practice what I spend my free volunteer time doing already. I have been looking for a way to not just spend my time doing that work, but to scale it out and help other people help others as well. I currently mentor 2-3 people on average at a time outside of the people I mentor at an employer. I spend my time helping them prep for career changes, be their unlicensed therapist, give them advice and guidance on life and work and everything in-between. There is nothing I value more in life than this type of work.

Overall I expect to be able to contribute around 8 hours of my time a week on average. Time measurement in work spread across the day, between meetings, at night, while reading and thinking about problem spaces, communicating in Discord or social media, is difficult to quantify. So this is not an objective goal, but an estimate of the type of energy that I have available to contribute.

I am the type of person who does not historically seek power but is granted it by being helpful in communities, usually made administrator or moderator of a community, and ultimately am now a people manager in tech. This may be the first time I have ever formally asked up front for some form of control or power to a new group of people, outside of tech job interviews. Writing this and selling myself is uncomfortable but I take this seriously enough that I'm doing it anyway.


## Goals

As a Member, I set the following goals for myself:
* Sponsor 2 candidates simultaneously on average. At this stage it's unclear how long in calendar time a sponsorship takes, or how much time it will take per person. It is also likely unique to the situation. So I would set a goal on how many different people I can feel comfortable being available to mentor at nearly the drop of a hat at any given time. This is in addition to the folks I mentor outside the organization. If they became sponsors
* Work on raising money, to get a baseline for what I can accomplish, and set a goal for continued fund raising off that. I will be doing this regardless of acceptance of Membership.
* 99% availability for voting. I cannot truly guarantee 100% but I will get as close as can, with likely planned and unplanned outages.

As a Member, I expect to contribute to the organization of the organization. That means helping other Members, including with how to help them with their candidates in addition to mine. That means writing content for the website where appropriate. That means making suggestions to improve things, and always be thinking of how to do even better. I do not set formal objective goals for this work - it is organic work that is done to build something that works well with people. It can mean introducing new formal objectively measurable however.

I also pledge a commitment to reevaluate goals as necessary. That means both directions, making them loftier or scaling them back. I do this type of goal resetting work frequently in my tech job, I am confident I can handle it on something that I am deeply passionate about. If I am to be one of the first Members, I will be trailblazing what goals really look like for myself and others and how they work in practice. They are not blind targets to be hit, they are tools we will use to actually help people sustainably at scale.


## Closing

Thank you for the consideration, and thank you for putting this together and doing this work regardless of what you decide.
